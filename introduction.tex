\section{Introduction}
Use the introduction section to introduce the problem to be tackled to a reader, who you can assume is trained in the field though may not be from the exact specific research direction of the project. Make sensible use of the associated literature (primary and secondary articles) to demonstrate the groundwork/importance of the problem at hand.

To adjust this template please see comments in the \textit{main.tex} file. To provide citations use \textbackslash cite\{name of the reference in the \textit{literature.bib} file\}. For example \textbackslash cite\{vogelpaper\} gives \cite{vogelpaper}. To provide citations with the author name before the number use \textbackslash citet\{...\} instead of \textbackslash cite\{...\} --- In the study of \textbackslash citet\{boccaccinipaper\} \citet{boccaccinipaper}...

The cited sources are then placed in the bibliography at the end of the report automatically in the ACS style. You do not have to worry about adjusting how the references look provided you have correctly included all the required information in the \textit{literature.bib} file. Take a look at the file to get a better understanding of how it works.
