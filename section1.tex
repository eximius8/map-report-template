\section{Theory}
This optional section should be used to introduce any important theoretical framework for your project e.g. important textbook equations or recently developed analytical approaches. This section may not be necessary for experimental miniprojects.

It is a good style to create a separate file for every section of your report and then include the sections using \textbackslash input\{section name\} command. This will allow to easily search specific parts of your report.
